1. A namespace provides a scope to identifiers which allows multiple namespace blocks with the same name. Can be used to make coding easier for teams using different languages (English, French, Spanish, etc.).

2. A header file contains declarations for variables and function prototypes for their respective modules in a convenient fashion. This organization can also lead to faster compiling from the compiler.

3. The header file only contains declarations and prototypes, so compiling them won't yield any results and serve no purpose.

4. Each .cpp file includes definitions and sourcing from a .h file, if you include each .cpp file they would cause a compiler error with multiple definitions.

5. In this workshop I have learned to disassemble a program and still have it function. I also learned the usefulness of namespace and also the efficiency of seperating a program into multiple modules.
