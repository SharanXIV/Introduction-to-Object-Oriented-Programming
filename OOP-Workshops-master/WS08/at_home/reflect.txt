Workshop 8 Reflection

1. The difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class is that an abstract class contains pure virtual functions and defines an interface while a concrete class is a derived class that implements that interface.

2. The 'credit', 'debit', 'monthEnd', 'display' and 'CreateAccount' functions are shadowing from 'iAccount'.
   The 'credit' and 'debit' functions are shadowing through 'Account' and 'ChequingAccount'.
   The 'monthEnd' and 'display' functions are shadowing through 'SavingsAccount' and 'ChequingAccount'.
   The 'CreateAccount' function is shadowing through 'Allocator'.

3. I have learned how to appropriately derived classes with multiple files from an abstract base class in a seperate module. I have also expanded my knowledge of shadow functions and virtual functions.
