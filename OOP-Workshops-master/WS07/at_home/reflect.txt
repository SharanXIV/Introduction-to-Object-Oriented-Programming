Workshop 7 Reflection

1. The base class (in this case, Hero) does not need to know about the derived class (SuperHero) because of class hierarchy. 


2. The derived class (SuperHero) needs the instance variables from the base class (Hero) so it must be aware of the base class' existence.

3. It had printed out "Ancient Battle!" because the base class (Hero) did not use the variables of the derived class.

4. Both would be valid since the overloaded '*' operator returns a valid Hero class, in this case it would be the winner.
